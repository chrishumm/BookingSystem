# BookingSystem

This program helps you organise bookings for performers or events. It is written in Java and uses the swing library to draw GUI. The performers and details are saved using SQL statements to a local Derby database.

It is currently an alpha, so expect some quirks.

# Features

- Organise bookings for different events
- Edit current events for different performers. 

# TODO

As an alpha product, things are not finished yet. Here is what I still need to implement.
- Add different venues
- Update/Delete seats in real time
- Host DB online


# Getting Started

You can download the jar and start playing around, or download the source code and compile it yurself.

## Installing from source (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have all the below installed:

- Eclipse
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

Clone the repo and open the project up in Eclipse.
